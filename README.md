# Learning-algorithms
Much of machine learning today revolves around using standard libraries and packages. Although it is important to be familiar with these to come up with practical and efficient solutions to real-world problems, I feel an in-depth understanding of the theory behind the actual algorithms is critical for any machine learning researcher. This repository contains my own implementations of different ML algorithms and data visualization tools as I discover my way around this fascinating field.

Implements LMS (Least Mean Squares) algorithm for binary classification.
Determines a linear boundary by minimizing the sum of squares of distances of the training samples to the separating hyperplane
Takes into account all training samples instead of just misclassified ones
Converges for linearly as well as nonlinearly separable datasets

Implements a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer. 
Can be extended to multiple hidden layers by specifying the number of hidden neurons in each layer.
Shown here is a classification of the iris dataset with 10 hidden neurons (98% training accuracy, 100% test accuracy on a random 2:1 split).

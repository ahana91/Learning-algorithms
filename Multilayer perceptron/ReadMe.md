Implements a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer. 
Can be extended to multiple hidden layers by specifying the number of hidden neurons in each layer.
Shown here is a classification of the iris dataset - a nonlinearly separable dataset with 3 classes and 150 samples.
With 10 hidden neurons, training accuracy is 98% and test accuracy is 100%  on a random 2:1 split.

Implements Rosenblatt's perceptron - a single-layer, single-neuron learning algorithm
for linearly separable data classification
Weights can be updated in online/batch mode
Datasets with linearly as well as non-linearly separable training and test data are provided
Note that perceptron will not converge with non-linearly separable data
